# One-Time Payments Google Pay Sample Integration

This HTML sample integration uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It does not require a build process to transpile the source code. It's just static files that can be served up by any web server. [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is used for the local web server to provide the following functionality:

1. Serve up the static HTML and JavaScript files.
2. Proxy the API server so both the client and server are running on port 3000.

## Prerequisites

Before running this sample integration, ensure that Google Pay is enabled in your sandbox account. Follow the instructions in the [PayPal documentation to integrate Google Pay](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/apm/google-pay/#set-up-your-sandbox-account-to-accept-google-pay) to set up your sandbox account to accept Google Pay payments.

## How to Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Sample Integration

This Google Pay integration demonstrates how to:

1. Initialize the PayPal SDK with Google Pay component from PayPal and the Native Google Pay SDK
2. Create a Google Pay session using the PayPal SDK
3. Configure Google Pay payment using the configuration options from the Google Pay Session generated by the PayPal SDK.
4. Generate Google Pay paysheet and create/capture order with PayPal.

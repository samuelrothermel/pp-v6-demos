# PayPal Guest Payments HTML Sample Integration

This demo showcases how to integrate PayPal Guest Payments as a payment method using PayPal's v6 Web SDK. This integration allows merchants to offer guest payments for their customers without logging in to PayPal.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This sample demonstrates several possible integration patterns for Guest Payments:

1. `onload` - Automatically open the Guest Payment form under the checkout button on page load. An eligibility request is required to check if the form can be shown to the current buyer.
2. `recommended` - The buyer can open the Guest Payment form by clicking on the checkout button.
3. `shipping` - You can use callbacks with custom behavior to respond to buyer changing their shipping address or options. Using shipping callbacks will automatically put the buyer in a `popup` or `modal` presentation mode.

The general structure of a Guest Payment integration is as follows:

1. Initialize PayPal Web SDK with the `paypal-guest-payments` component.
2. Using the SDK instance, call eligibility to determine which presentation modes will be available to the buyer.
3. Start the guest checkout session either on page load, or when the buyer clicks the Guest Payment button.

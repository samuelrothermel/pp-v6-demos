# One-Time Payments HTML Sample Integration

This HTML sample integration uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It does not require a build process to transpile the source code. It's just static files that can be served up by any web server. [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is used for the local web server to provide the following functionality:

1. Serve up the static HTML and JavaScript files.
2. Proxy the API server so both the client and server are running on port 3000.

## How to Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

| [Recommended](src/recommended/index.html)                                    | Start with this recommended sample integration. It displays all buttons supported by the v6 SDK and includes eligibility logic. It uses the "auto" presentation mode which attempts to launch a popup window and then automatically falls back to the modal presentation mode when the browser does not support popups.                                                                                       |
| [Merchant Async Validation](src/advanced/merchantAsyncValidation/index.html) | This advanced integration demonstrates how to perform asynchronous validation while maintaining proper user transient activation for popup windows. It shows how to pass validation logic as a promise to the SDK's .start() method to prevent popup blocking issues.                                                                                                                                         |
| [Payment Handler](src/advanced/paymentHandler/index.html)                    | This advanced integration uses the experimental "payment-handler" presentation mode. It teaches how to control the fallback logic for presentation modes based on what the browser supports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Redirect](src/advanced/redirect/index.html)                                 | This advanced integration uses the "redirect" presentation mode. It teaches how to do a full-page redirect integration with the PayPal button on button click.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Direct App Switch](src/advanced/directAppSwitch/index.html)                 | This advanced integration uses the "direct-app-switch" presentation mode. It teaches how to do a full-page redirect integration with the PayPal button on button click. Eligible buyers will instead checkout the the PayPal mobile app.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Custom Sandboxed Iframe](src/advanced/sandboxedIframe/README.md)            | This advanced integration demonstrates how a merchant can wrap the v6 SDK integration code into their own iframe and what values need to be passed to the [iframe sandbox attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox). It does require two web servers to demonstrate the use case. Refer to the README in the src/advanced/sandboxedIframe directory to learn more. |

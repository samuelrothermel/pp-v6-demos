# One-Time Payments HTML Sandboxed Iframe Sample Integration

In this example, we serve a merchant page with an embedded iframe on a different domain. The iframe interacts
with a server using the PayPal Server SDK and uses `postMessage` to the merchant page. This demonstrates the v6 ability
to work entirely in an iframe.

To start this example:

1. Start a server in the `server/` directory. Note, the server needs to provide the following endpoints:
   1. `GET /paypal-api/auth/browser-safe-client-token`
   2. `POST /paypal-api/checkout/orders/create-with-sample-data`
   3. `POST /paypal-api/checkout/orders/:orderId/capture`

2. Start the merchant page and iframe servers (uses [`concurrently`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently)):

   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to `localhost:3001` to see the page.

# PayPal Messages HTML Sample Integration

This HTML sample integration uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It does not require a build process to transpile the source code. It's just static files that can be served up by any web server. [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is used for the local web server to provide the following functionality:

1. Serve up the static HTML and JavaScript files.
2. Proxy the API server so both the client and server are running on port 3000.

## How to Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
